## Features

* Run Gmail right from the Taskbar(in Windows) or from the Menubar(in macOS).
* App will keep alive in tray for quick usage.
* Uses Gmail's UI for mobile so it's best to use within menubar/taskbar.
* Cross platform
  - Windows and macOS. On Linux, menubar [isn't working correctly](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/6773).

## How To Use

Install it using : `npm install correo`

*Or*

Clone this repository, and run

```
$> cd PATH-TO-CORREO

```
